# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and the jQuery library for the front end. Node.js and Express are implemented for the backend and AJAX requests are used to fetch tweets from the hard-coded database present in the project files. Tweeter is a responsive website and implements media queries to change the layout when the user's window size is below 1025px. This project also implements stretch features such-as an animated "write a new tweet" button, a hidden tweet field that uses the jQuery slide-down/slide-up methods to appear/dissapear and a button that appears on scroll that redirects the user back to the top of the page when pressed.
