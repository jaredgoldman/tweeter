# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. The front end is  built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the jQuery library. Node.js and Express are implemented for the back end and AJAX requests are used to fetch tweets from the hard-coded database present in the project files. Tweeter is a responsive website and implements media queries to change the layout when the users window size is below 1025px. This project also implements stretch features such-as an animated "write a new tweet" button, a hidden tweet field that uses the jQuery slideDown/slideUp methods to appear/dissapear and a button that appears on scroll that redirects the user back to the top of the page when pressed.
